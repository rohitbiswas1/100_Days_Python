    # Arithmetic Operators 
    # Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and values.

    #Addition of the variables

a=8
b=2
sum=a+b
print("Sum of",a,"and",b,"is",sum)
    #Difference of the variables
d=5
e=8
diff=d-e
print("Difference of",d,"and",e,"is",diff)
    #Product of the variables
p=4  
q=5 
product=p*q     
print("Product of",p,"and",q,"is",product)
    #Division of the variables
d=8
e=2
div=d/e
print("Division of",d,"and",e,"is",div)
    #Modulus of the variables
m=9
n=2
mod=m%n

  #Power of the variable 
z= 9

 #Relational Operators
 #Relational operators are used to compare two values.
 
 #Equal to operator

 #Greater than operator

#Less than or equal to operator

    #Assignment Operators
    #Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
 #Equal to operator

    #Divide and assign operator
num7 = 5
num8 = 3
num7 /= num8
print("Value of num7 is", num7)
    #Modulus and assign operator
num9 = 5

    #Power and assign operator
num11 = 5

  #Logical Operator 
#Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
